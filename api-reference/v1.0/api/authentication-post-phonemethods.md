# Create phoneMethod

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Add a new [phone authentication method](../resources/phoneauthenticationmethod.md) for a user. A user may only have one phone of each type, captured in the **phoneType** property. This means, for example, adding a `mobile` phone to a user with a preexisting `mobile` phone will fail. Additionally, a user must always have a `mobile` phone before adding an `alternateMobile` phone.

Adding a phone number makes it available for use in both Azure multi-factor authentication (MFA) and self-service password reset (SSPR), if enabled.

Additionally, if a user is enabled by policy to use SMS sign-in and a `mobile` number is added, the system will attempt to register the number for use in that system.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

### Permissions acting on self

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Not supported. |

### Permissions acting on other users

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |

For delegated scenarios where an admin is acting on another user, the admin needs one of the following [Azure AD roles](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles):

* Global administrator
* Privileged authentication administrator
* Authentication administrator

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /me/authentication/phoneMethods
POST /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/authentication/phoneMethods
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description   |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of a [phoneAuthenticationMethod](../resources/phoneauthenticationmethod.md) object. The JSON must include `phoneNumber` and `phoneType`, but not `smsSignInState` (which is read-only).

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
|phoneNumber|String|The phone number to text or call for authentication. Phone numbers use the format `+{country code} {number}x{extension}`, with extension optional. For example, `+1 5555551234` or `+1 5555551234x123` are valid. Numbers are rejected when creating or updating if they do not match the required format.|
|phoneType|String|Possible values are: `mobile`, `alternateMobile`, and `office`.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a new [phoneAuthenticationMethod](../resources/phoneauthenticationmethod.md) object in the response body.
