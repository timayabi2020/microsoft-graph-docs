To use application permission for this API, tenant administrators must create an [application access policy](/graph/cloud-communication-online-meeting-application-access-policy) and grant it to a user to authorize the app configured in the policy to fetch online meetings and/or online meeting artifacts on behalf of that user (with user ID specified in the request path).
