# taskReport: summary (of a lifecycle workflow)

Namespace: microsoft.graph.identityGovernance

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get a [taskReportSummary](../resources/identitygovernance-taskreportsummary.md) object.

This API provides a summary of task processing results for a specified time period. Because the volume of task processing results and task reports returned by the List API calls can be overwhelming, this summary allows the administrator to get a quick overview based on counts.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|

|Delegated (work or school account)|LifecycleWorkflows.Read.All, LifecycleWorkflows.ReadWrite.All|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not supported.|
|Application|LifecycleWorkflows.Read.All, LifecycleWorkflows.ReadWrite.All|

For delegated scenarios, the admin needs one of the following [Azure AD roles](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles):

- Global administrator
- Global reader
- Lifecycle workflows administrator
